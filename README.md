## MOVIE LENS BUT WITH DJANGO THIS TIME ##

The program is meant to be an educational tool to practice django app creation
and handling large amounts of data in a different environment.

To fully use this program, the user will need to create a username, and include
demographic information for movie recommendations (this feature is coming soon!
) This will allow the user to view lists of movies, as well as look at their
own profile, rate movies, and look at different raters and see what movies/
ratings they have included in their profile.  Users will only be able to rate
movies they haven't already rated, and being able to change ratings and profile
information is in the works.

In addition to these utilities, a user will also be able to look up a list of
top 20 ratings, and eventually be able to search by movie name.
